                    <p class="game-comment">Being a huge fan of the Alien universe and of H.R. Giger, this game is not only one 
                    of the best Horror Games on the market, it also respects the franchise wonderfully. Every aspect of this game is well done, 
                    from the art direction, to the soundscape, the tension in the gameplay and the storytelling.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">It's prodigious. If you're an Alien fan, don't wait, it's really impossible to be disappointed.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">A narrative and visual masterpiece. I've never been so captivated by a 
                    video game. The visual and audio atmosphere, the dialogues and the romances really grabbed me by 
                    the guts. For the first time, a video game succeeded in getting me sentimentally attached to characters.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">Once I'd finished the game, I felt a void and a lack, as I recalled certain memories from the story. 
                    I had the same impression with the Phantom Liberty DLC, just as exceptional in quality.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">Definitely an absolute must if you love Cyberpunk and deep storytelling.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">An extraction shooter made by Crytek that mixes Wild West, Bayou, Zombies and Monsters that works too damn well, the atmosphere 
                    is extremely well crafted and oppressive, right down to the little noises that can betray you.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">Play it in the dark, preferably with a headset, it's an online game but it's really worth it, the 
                    Art Direction is exceptional and unique.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">Don't be fooled by its old-school look, I say with full confidence that this is the most realistic game of its genre.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">A Masterpiece not in its visuals, but in its mechanics and overall atmosphere.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">A little cat game without too much dialogue, but which manages to tell a touching story. 
                    Its strength also lies in the sumptuous Art Direction, and this world that mixes cats and robots, it's really a unique game that I won't forget.</p>

                      living the story of a scientist cosmonaut who finds herself lost in a mystery on an unknown planet, hunted by an anomaly of unknown origin.</p>
