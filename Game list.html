                    <p class="game-comment">Being a huge fan of the Alien universe and of H.R. Giger, this game is not only one 
                    of the best Horror Games on the market, it also respects the franchise wonderfully. Every aspect of this game is well done, 
                    from the art direction, to the soundscape, the tension in the gameplay and the storytelling.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">It's prodigious. If you're an Alien fan, don't wait, it's really impossible to be disappointed.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">A narrative and visual masterpiece. I've never been so captivated by a 
                    video game. The visual and audio atmosphere, the dialogues and the romances really grabbed me by 
                    the guts. For the first time, a video game succeeded in getting me sentimentally attached to characters.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">Once I'd finished the game, I felt a void and a lack, as I recalled certain memories from the story. 
                      I had the same impression with the Phantom Liberty DLC, just as exceptional in quality.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">Definitely an absolute must if you love Cyberpunk and deep storytelling.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">A little cat game without too much dialogue, but which manages to tell a touching story. 
                    Its strength also lies in the sumptuous Art Direction, and this world that mixes cats and robots, it's really a unique game that I won't forget.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">Based on the novel by Stanisław Lem, it takes place on an unknown planet with Soviet-style equipment.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">Captivating game, unique Art Direction. I had a great time on this walking simulator, 
                      living the story of a cosmonaut who finds herself lost in a mystery on an unknown planet, hunted by an anomaly of unknown origin.</p>

                    <p class="game-comment">A Fast FPS made by Embark studio (Ex-Battlefield Guys) that is absolutely revolutionary in its conception.</p>
                    <p class="game-comment">I play it very regularly, and it deserves its place among the best fast fps of all time. May The Finals live forever!</p>
